# Block Report Template

**Structure only — no data. Replace `[placeholders]` with actual values.**

Generated at end of each training block (3–5 weeks).

Polarization (block average):
  Z1+Z2: [XX.X]%
  Z3 (Grey Zone): [X.X]% (target <5%)
  Z4+ (Quality): [X.X]% (target ~20% of intensity sessions)
  Classification: [Classification] (PI: [X.XX])
  Hard days/week avg: [X.X]

Polarization by Week:
  Wk 1: Z1+Z2 [XX]%, Z3 [X]%, Z4+ [X]% — [Classification] (PI: [X.XX])
  Wk 2: Z1+Z2 [XX]%, Z3 [X]%, Z4+ [X]% — [Classification] (PI: [X.XX])
  Wk 3: Z1+Z2 [XX]%, Z3 [X]%, Z4+ [X]% — [Classification] (PI: [X.XX])
  Wk 4: Z1+Z2 [XX]%, Z3 [X]%, Z4+ [X]% — [Classification] (PI: [X.XX])

Wellness (block avg vs previous block):
  HRV: [XX] ms (prev block: [XX] ms) [↑/↓/→] [assessment]
  RHR: [XX] bpm (prev block: [XX] bpm) [↑/↓/→] [assessment]
  Sleep: [X.X]h (prev block: [X.X]h) [↑/↓/→] [assessment]
  Avg RI: [X.XX] (prev block: [X.XX])
  Avg Monotony: [X.XX] ([note])

Section 11 Flags During Block:
  [List each flag with date and resolution, or "None"]

Phase Progression Check:
  Block objective: [what this block was designed to achieve]
  Criteria met: [Y/N — reference Section 11 phase detection triggers]
  Phase recommendation: [Continue current / Progress to next / Extend / Insert recovery]
  Rationale: [1-2 sentences explaining why, based on metrics above]

Assessment:
[3-5 sentences — did the block achieve its goals? What adapted?
What stalled? Recovery status entering next block. Key wins and
concerns. Block-over-block comparison where relevant.]

Next Block Plan:
  Phase: [planned phase]
  Duration: [X] weeks
  Focus: [primary training objective]
  Key changes: [what's different from this block]
  Targets: [specific metrics to hit — CTL target, FTP test date, etc.]
```

## Field Definitions

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Volume Progression** | Weekly hours + TSS + CTL | Week-by-week CTL shows load trajectory, not just endpoints |
| **Compliance** | Planned vs completed across block | Include reasons for misses — illness, fatigue, life |
| **Fitness Progression** | Start vs end of block | CTL delta is the headline number |
| **eFTP** | Intervals.icu estimated FTP | Track alongside formal FTP — catches drift |
| **Performance Markers** | Best efforts + target comparison | Shows whether stimulus is producing adaptation |
| **Decoupling trend** | Long ride aerobic efficiency | Improving decoupling = aerobic base building |
| **Polarization by Week** | Weekly zone distributions | Catches grey zone creep within a block |
| **Wellness assessment** | Directional + threshold label | "declining — monitor" / "stable — no concern" / "improving" |
| **Phase Progression Check** | Section 11 phase detection criteria | Explicitly states whether block met progression criteria |
| **Section 11 Flags** | All flags triggered during block | With dates and how they were resolved |

## Assessment Labels

### Wellness Direction
| Direction | Threshold | Label |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| ↑ >5% improvement | HRV up, RHR down | "improving" |
| → <5% change | Stable | "stable — no concern" |
| ↓ 5–10% decline | Mild drift | "declining — monitor" |
| ↓ >10% decline | Significant | "declining — flag" |

### Phase Progression Criteria (Reference)
| Current Phase | Progress When | Stay When | Regress When |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Base Build | CTL target met, decoupling <5%, compliance >85% | Approaching targets, no flags | HRV declining, compliance <70%, flags triggered |
| Threshold | FTP improved or eFTP trending up, key sessions hit targets | Making progress, manageable fatigue | Stalled power, wellness declining |
| Peak | Race-specific targets met, form (TSB) improving | Still sharpening | Overreached indicators |
| Recovery | RI >0.90, HRV baseline restored, TSB >+10 | Still recovering | N/A — extend until criteria met |

## Notes

- **Week-by-week CTL** is critical — the trajectory tells a different story than just start/end
- **Polarization by Week** catches grey zone creep that block averages can mask
- **Phase Progression Check** makes the protocol's decision logic transparent to the athlete
- **Next Block Plan** should flow directly from the Phase Progression Check — if criteria aren't met, explain what the next block does differently
- Keep "Assessment" to coaching interpretation — the data is already presented above
- Block reports are the most detailed report type (~45-60 lines) — this is where the deep analysis lives
